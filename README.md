# Predictive-Analytics-Project-on-Airbnb-Data-Econ386

A group of students and I evaluated data from Airbnb sites in San Diego from January 2020 to examine the variables that affect price and property type of a listing. We identified, cleaned, and preprocessed the dataset before developing models in R. Once we had TIDY data, we developed a regression model in R to predict the price of Airbnb listings. We then completed a classification task to predict its property type (house vs not a house).
